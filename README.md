# Athena



Athena, which happens to be the name of my computer, is a vocal assistant project that I have been fiddling around for quite some time.

It is meant to run as a daemon, in particular as a user systemd service.

It uses [Snowboy](https://github.com/Kitt-AI/snowboy) as a Hotword Detection Engine
